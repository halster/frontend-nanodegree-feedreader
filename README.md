# Project Overview

This project takes a feed reader site and implements some tests to make sure that it runs as planned.  

## Setting up
Go to github and download the [repo](https://github.com/halster/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git) Then open the index.html file to see the website and the list of tests that are passing at the bottom.  
If you want to see where the tests are written you can look at the feedreader.js file to see all the tests.
